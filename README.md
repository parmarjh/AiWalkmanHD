## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9+ installed and FFmpeg available for audio processing.

### 2. Installation
Install the required dependencies directly from your terminal:
```bash
pip install opencv-contrib-python moviepy streamlit tqdm requests fastapi uvicorn python-multipart
```

### 3. Run the Dashboard (Windows)
If you get an error saying `'streamlit' is not recognized`, use this command:
```powershell
python -m streamlit run app.py
```
*Note: Make sure you are inside the `ai_video_upscaler` folder.*

### 4. Run the API (For Developers)
To use the upscaler in other applications:
```powershell
python -m uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```
API Documentation will be available at: `http://localhost:8000/docs`

## 📖 How to Use
1. **Launch**: Run the app using the `python -m` command above.
2. **Open Browser**: Go to `http://localhost:8501` in your web browser (Chrome/Edge). Do **not** type the URL in the terminal.
3. **Upload or Stream**: 
   - Use the **File Upscale** tab for 90s movies on your computer.
   - Use the **Live TV / HDMI** tab for online streams and IPTV.
4. **Configure**: Select your preferred AI model (FSRCNN is fastest).
5. **Process**: Click **"Start AI Upscaling"**.
6. **HDMI Output**: Drag the resulting Live window to your TV screen and press 'F'.
